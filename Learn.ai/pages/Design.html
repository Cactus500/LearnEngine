        <h2 style="animation-duration: 1s;">Introduction</h2>
        <p style="animation-duration: 1.25s;">Accent colours are <font style="font-weight: bolder;">pivotal</font> in graphic design, serving as strategic elements to draw attention and create visual interest within a composition. These colours, typically contrasting or complementary to the primary palette, inject vibrancy and dynamism into designs, guiding the viewer's eye to key elements or messages. Whether used sparingly or boldly, accent colours can evoke specific emotions or associations, enhancing the overall impact of the design. By carefully selecting and deploying accent colours, designers can amplify hierarchy, emphasize important information, and establish a cohesive visual identity for brands or projects.</p>
        <p style="animation-duration: 1.5s;">Incorporating accent colours requires a delicate balance to ensure they harmonize with the overall aesthetic without overwhelming the design. Designers often leverage colour theory principles to choose accent hues that resonate with the brand's personality or the intended message. Additionally, considering factors such as cultural connotations and psychological responses to colours helps designers craft compelling visuals that resonate with their target audience. Whether a subtle pop of colour or a striking contrast, accent colours wield significant influence in guiding the viewer's perception and enhancing the effectiveness of graphic communication.</p>
        <h2 style="animation-duration: 1.75s;">Main Rules</h2>
        <p style="animation-duration: 2s;">The main rules of colour schemes in graphic design revolve around principles of harmony, contrast, and balance:</p>
        <ol style="animation-duration: 2.25s;">
            <li style="animation-duration: 2.5s;">Complementary Colors: Colors opposite each other on the colour wheel create strong contrast and vibrancy, making them suitable for emphasizing key elements.</li>
            <li style="animation-duration: 2.75s;">Analogous Colors: Colors adjacent to each other on the colour wheel harmonize well and create a sense of unity and coherence in a design.</li>
            <li style="animation-duration: 3s;">Triadic Colors: Three colours equidistant from each other on the colour wheel form a triadic colour scheme, balancing contrast and harmony.</li>
            <li style="animation-duration: 3.25s;">Monochromatic Colors: Variations of a single colour (hue) create a harmonious and sophisticated colour scheme, relying on differences in value and saturation for contrast.</li>
            <li style="animation-duration: 3.5s;">Split-Complementary Colors: Similar to complementary colours but less intense, this scheme uses a base colour and two colours adjacent to its complement, providing contrast while maintaining harmony.</li>
            <li style="animation-duration: 4s;">Tetradic Colors: Also known as double complementary, this scheme uses two pairs of complementary colours, offering a wide range of possibilities but requiring careful balance to avoid overwhelming the design.</li>
        </ol>
